		<h1> A DataSet About College Majors</h1>
		<p><b>What kind of Data am i researching about and why?</b> </br></br>
		My name is Max Juarez and i'm currently enrolled in Lehman College. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science while also trying to minor in mathematics. Since the day i had first enrolled in my very first class, i am proud to say that i have debated on pursuing in a different degree rather than trying to major in Computer Science thus the DataSet about College Majors piqued my interest. 
		</br>
		</br>
		<b>Why did it piqued my interest? </b>
		</br>
		</br>
		I've always thought that technology will soon evolve to something greater that might eventually shape the whole world into something magnificent so i wanted to see whether or not Computer Science had a lot of enrolls. I was also interested in other majors that i wanted to try out other than Computer Science.</p>

		<p>Citation:</br></br> I want to give a huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight">FiveThirdyEight</a> on Github for the huge amount of DataSets that was posted to the public. Without this, i wouldn't had been able to come across the <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors">all-ages.csv</a></br></br> Also, the all-ages.csv was based on an article called <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/">The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major</a> which also has a bunch of information regarding college majors and goes in depth on the good and bad sides of some majors.</p>
