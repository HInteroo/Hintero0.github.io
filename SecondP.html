		<h1> What is "Employed"?</h1>
		<p>The Employed column of my dataframe is defined as the amount of people that are employed by the major they had majored. The mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis are: 
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Mean:</b> 166162
			<br>
			<b>Standard Deviation:</b> 307324.4 
			<br>
			<b>Skewness:</b> 3.769423 
			<br>
			<b>Kurtosis:</b> 18.03576 

		</p>
		<h1>BoxPlot and Histogram of the data "Employed"</h1>
			<img id="BoxE" src="Data/Boxplot_E.png" class="center"/>
			<p> The boxplot is similar to the <b>Total</b> boxplot and it helps the viewer see the pieces of data that are detached from the box's 4th quarter. The 24 outliers are the same outliers that the column <b>Total</b> displayed on it's own boxplot graph thus implying that the most popular major with the most total number of majors are most likely be able to seek a job than those majors that aren't as popular as they seem to be on the boxplot. These outliers had values greater than 350,000.</p>
			<img id="HistE" src="Data/Hist_E.png " class="center"/>
			<p>Similar to the <b>Total</b> boxplot, a positive skewness and postive kurtosis made me believe that the graph was slightly skewed towards the right and had a platykurtic curve. Yet, the histogram displayed a random distribution. The only differences i saw on the <b>Total's</b> histogram and <b>Employed's</b> histogram are the indexes. The indexes displays the number of employed/total students.</p>
		<h1>Computing a confidence interval for the "Employed" # 2: </h1>
			<p> Knowing that the mean of the data "Employed" has mean = 166162, standard deviation = 307324.4, and the dataset has a length of n = 173. We can compute the margin of error by adding/subtracting the mean from the confidence level times the  standard deviation over the square root of n (230256.6 Â± 1.959964 * 307324.4/sqrt(173)) which gives us the range where the true mean lands on: [120366.6, 211957.4].</p>
