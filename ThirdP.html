		<h1> What is "Unemployement_rate"?</h1>
		<p>The Unemployed_rate column of my dataframe is defined as the rate in which unemployment happens on each majors listed on the all-ages.csv dataframe. The equation for unemployment rate is given by (Unemployed / (Unemployed + Employed)). The mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis are:  
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Mean:</b> 0.05735545
			<br>
			<b>Standard Deviation:</b> 0.0191771 
			<br>
			<b>Skewness:</b> 0.6928492 
			<br>
			<b>Kurtosis:</b> 3.644075
		</p>
		<h1>BoxPlot and Histogram of the data "Unemployement_rate"</h1>
			<img id="BoxUR" src="Data/Boxplot_UR.png" class="center"/>
			<p> The boxplot of <b>Unemployement_rate</b> is unique in that it was different than the boxplot of both <b>Total</b> and <b>Employed</b>. This is significantly great because it shows 4 outliers that are dissimilar than the outliers of <b>Total</b> and <b>Employed</b> and when something is dissimilar, unexpected things can be found. The boxplot shows the percentage(s) of the <b>Unemployement_rate</b>, a small number than the amount of students since the amount of students exceeded more than 350,000, the Unemployment_rate did not. The data has a standard deviation of 0.019, a number that is quite closer to 0. The standard deviation shows how not spread out the data are from one another as seen on the boxplot. </p>
			<img id="BoxUR" src="Data/Hist_UR.png" class="center"/>
			<p> The histogram is also another plot that is different than both <b>Total</b> and <b>Employed</b> for the same reason as the numbers of <b>Unemployement_rate</b> being small digits. The data's mean is 0.057 as shawn in the histogram with a standard deviation of 0.019. The skewness however is 0.69 slightly closer to 0. A skewness of 0 has a normal distribution but because the <b>Unemployement_rate's</b> skewness is not equal to 0, it can be assume that the distribution is slight skewed towards the right. Similar to the kurtosis of both <b>Total</b> and <b>Employed</b>, the data has a platykurtic curve which sadly enough contradicts what the histogram shows.</p>
		<h1>Computing the confidence interval for the "Unemployement_rate" # 3: </h1>
			<p> Knowing that the mean of the data "Unemployement_rate" has mean = 0.05735545, standard deviation = 0.0191771, and the dataset has a length of n = 173. We can compute the margin of error by adding/subtracting the mean from the confidence level times the  standard deviation over the square root of n (0.05735545 Â± 1.959964 * 0.0191771/sqrt(173)) which gives us the range where the true mean lands on: [0.05449781, 0.0602131].</p>
